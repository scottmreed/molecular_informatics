    "SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is a compact, text-based way to represent chemical structures using ASCII characters. Developed in the 1980s to encode molecular graphs for computers, SMILES captures atoms, bonds, branching, and ring structures in a linear string. While modern software can generate SMILES automatically, understanding how they work provides insight into how chemical information is stored, searched, and shared in databases and cheminformatics tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Daylight Theory Manual](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/) is the foundational reference for understanding how SMILES work. Created by the developers of the original SMILES system at Daylight Chemical Information Systems, this manual outlines the principles behind molecular graph representation, atom and bond encoding, and the syntax rules that govern how structures are translated into strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [Daylight SMILES Tutorial](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml_tutorials/languages/smiles/index.html) is another valuable resource, offering a practical introduction to writing and interpreting SMILES. For those curious about the origin story and cultural quirks behind SMILES, this [Chemistry World](https://www.chemistryworld.com/opinion/weiningers-smiles/4014639.article) article provides an engaging look at its history and the chemist who created it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[RDKit](https://rdkit.org/) is an open-source cheminformatics toolkit that makes it easy to work with chemical structures in Python. It allows you to read, manipulate, visualize, and analyze molecules using formats like SMILES, SDF, and more. With RDKit, you can generate 2D or 3D structures, calculate molecular properties, perform substructure searches, and integrate chemistry into data science workflows. It’s a powerful tool for anyone working at the intersection of chemistry and programming."

    "While SMILES is widely used, it’s important to know that the original Daylight SMILES format is proprietary and maintained by Daylight Chemical Information Systems. Over time, other organizations and toolkits, such as OpenEye, OpenSMILES and RDKit, have implemented their own versions of SMILES, each with slight differences in syntax rules, aromaticity perception, or handling of tautomers. This means that the same molecule may be represented by different SMILES strings depending on the software generating it. So while SMILES is a powerful and convenient representation, it’s not always perfectly standardized across platforms. This is important to keep in mind when working with multiple tools or databases."

    "### 3D Mol Files\n",
    "SMILES strings are great for capturing the basics of a molecule (such as atom types, bonding patterns, formal charges, and stereochemistry) but they only represent 2D connectivity. Even when you convert a SMILES to a Mol object and generate a mol file, you'll notice that the coordinate section often includes only X and Y values, with all Z-coordinates set to 0. That’s because SMILES doesn’t encode 3D geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate 3D coordinates, RDKit can apply molecular mechanics methods such as the Universal Force Field (UFF) or Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFF). These algorithms estimate a three-dimensional structure by minimizing molecular strain. Keep in mind, though, that while these methods provide reasonable 3D conformations, they don’t always yield the lowest-energy conformation. For many applications, they’re good enough. For more rigorous modeling further optimization or conformer sampling may be necessary."
