The sequence that represents this gene can be used as a string in coding - computation with strings is orders of magnitude faster than computation with 3D structures.

Likewise we can represent the RNA transcribed from this sequence as a list of characters where T is replaced by U.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you study proteins or proteomics, you know that protein function depends on protein structure.

    "\n",
    "Consider the molecule ethanol. The image below shows a representation that we are used to seeing in chemistry:\n",

    "\n",
    "You can read more about SMILES at [this tutorial](https://archive.epa.gov/med/med_archive_03/web/html/smiles.html), but rules for atoms and bonds are also repeated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Atoms\n",
    "SMILES supports all elements in the periodic table. An atom is represented using its respective atomic symbol. Upper case letters refer to non-aromatic atoms; lower case letters refer to aromatic atoms. If the atomic symbol has more than one letter the second letter must be lower case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonds\n",
    "```\n",
    "-\tSingle bond\n",
    "=\tDouble bond\n",
    "#\tTriple bond\n",
    "*\tAromatic bond\n",
    ".\tDisconnected structures\n",
    "```\n",
    "Single bonds are the default and therefore need not be entered. For example, 'CC' would mean that there is a non-aromatic carbon attached to another non-aromatic carbon by a single bond, and the computer would identify the structure as the chemical ethane. It is also assumed that the bond between two lower case atom symbols is aromatic. A blank terminates the SMILES string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "A branch from a chain is specified by placing the SMILES symbol(s) for the branch between parenthesis. Some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "CC(O)C\t2-Propanol\n",
    "CC(=O)C\t2-Propanone\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rings\n",
    "\n",
    "A ring is specified by placing a number directly after the SMILES symbol where the ring closure occurs. This number acts as a marker, indicating that the atoms with the same number are connected, thus forming a ring. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "C1CCCC1   cyclopentane\n",
    "n1ccccc1  Pyridine\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### SMILES Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "![SMILES Example 1](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1-MFSoAGwqOPiqIUD06reOkBPx4BTMhGC)\n",
    "\n",
    "![SMILES Example 2](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=18Ub9L98y8cL_lDLF9wl6pLQxCkt8JFqu)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Online Resources\n",
    "Most of the time, you will not need to write a SMILES string by hand. You will be able to look up a molecule's SMILES string from a web database like [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use tools like this [molecule sketcher from the Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/chemical-sketch)\n",
    "to draw molecules and get their SMILES strings."
