    "## 5. Summary and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated a workflow for predicting the protonation states of small molecules and their subsequent partitioning behavior in different solvent conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Steps and Takeaways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Environment Setup:** We installed necessary packages like `rdkit-pypi`, `dimorphite-dl`, and `molvs`.\n",
    "2.  **Protonation State Prediction:** Using `dimorphite-dl`, we predicted the dominant ionization states of example molecules (Acetic Acid, Methylamine, Glycine, Benzene) at physiological pH (7.4), highly acidic conditions (pH 0 for 1M acid), and highly basic conditions (pH 14 for 1M base). This step is crucial as the charge of a molecule significantly impacts its properties.\n",
    "3.  **LogP Calculation:** We calculated the Crippen LogP values for each relevant protonation state using RDKit. This allowed us to quantify the lipophilicity/hydrophilicity of each form. We observed that charged species generally have lower LogP values.\n",
    "4.  **Partitioning Prediction:** By combining the protonation state information with the LogP values, we predicted whether each molecule would preferentially partition into an organic solvent or an aqueous solution (1M acid or 1M base).\n",
    "    *   For example, a carboxylic acid like Acetic Acid is neutral and more lipophilic at low pH, but becomes charged (deprotonated) and more hydrophilic at neutral and high pH.\n",
    "    *   An amine like Methylamine is charged (protonated) and more hydrophilic at low and neutral pH, but becomes neutral and more lipophilic at high pH.\n",
    "    *   Zwitterionic compounds like Glycine can have complex behavior depending on which group ionizes.\n",
    "    *   Neutral compounds like Benzene show little change in LogP with pH.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is valuable in many areas of chemistry and drug discovery, such as understanding drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME), or designing extraction and separation protocols."
