    "# Cheminformatics with RDKit\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces a popular and versatile Python cheminformatics library known as RDKit which is useful for tasks such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualizing molecules\n",
    "- Reading SMILES or InChI molecular representations\n",
    "- Quantifying structural features in molecules such as number of rings or hydrogen bond donors\n",
    "- Generating all possible stereoisomers of a molecular structure\n",
    "- Filtering molecules based on structural features\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a popular library for those in chemical computing research with examples of its use being relatively easy to find in the chemical literature. As of this writing, RDKit can be installed with either conda or pip (see [section 0.2.1](0.2.1) and link below). If you are using Google Colab, you will need to install RDKit at the top of your notebook (see [section 0.2.2](0.2.2)) as it is not installed by default in Colab.\n"

In both these applications, RDKit treats any explicitly assigned stereocenter as fixed and will not allow it to be changed. For example, below we will again look at (2*S*, 3*E*)-pent-3-en-2-ol. Because the structure already designates this as the (2*S*, 3*E*) isomer, the stereochemistry of the chiral center and alkene cannot be changed.
