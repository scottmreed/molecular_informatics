        "The synthetic accessibility score (SAscore) provides an estimation of how easy it is to synthesize a given molecule. Developed by Peter Ertl and Ansgar Schuffenhauer, the SAscore combines fragment contributions and molecular complexity to generate a score between 1 (easy to synthesize) and 10 (difficult to synthesize). This is particularly useful in drug discovery to help prioritize molecules based on their synthetic feasibility. In this notebook, we will explore how to calculate the SAscore using RDKit, a popular cheminformatics toolkit in Python."
