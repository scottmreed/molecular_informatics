    "\n",
    "PubChem's Power User Gateway(PUG) REST interface is a web-based Application Programming Interface (API) that allows for programmatic access to PubChem's chemical database. Specifically it is a RESTful API, meaning it follows the Representational State Transfer(REST) interface. REST uses standard web protocols (like HTTP) to enable users to retrieve information using simple URL-based queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a REST API, each request for data sent to the server is independent and contains all the information required to fulfill the request. The server does not retain any information from previous requests or even other user sessions. Therefore, it can be easily automated programmatically since connections or sessions do not need to be maintained. \n",
