    "## What is a bit vector?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the last activity that we downloaded PubChem fingerprints initially as Base64-encoded strings. We then decoded them into bit strings, which are a human readable sequence of 1s and 0s. PubChem stores fingerprints in Base64 format because it allows for safer and more efficient transmission through application programming interfaces (API) like PUG REST. Additionally, databases can handle text-based formats like Base64 more easily than raw binary data. \n",
    "\n",
    "A bit vector is a data structure designed to efficiently store and manipulate binary data. While a bit string is human readable, it isn't optimized for computation. A bit vector allows the computer to quickly determine which bits are set on or off, or compare two strings for differences. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a bit string as a literal sequence of 1's and 0's. It has no structure or behavior. However, a bit vector is like a structured container where each bit is stored in separate boxes with information about what is stored in each box. These boxes of data can be acted upon computationally, which we will explore in the Molecular Similarity Part 2 notebook."

    "## Bit Vectors in RDKit\n",
    "Instead of using a bit string, RDKit uses bit vectors to store molecular fingerprints. Each 1 and 0 in a bit vector takes up just 1 bit of memory, whereas storing the same data as bit string requires much more memory as each character typically uses a full bit (8 bits = 1 byte). \n",
    "\n",
    "Another key advantage is that the bit vector allows for efficient indexing and manipulation of the individual bits. This makes comparing two fingerprints very fast and memory efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the last activity you generated MACCS keys and Morgan Fingerprints using RDKit's built-in functions. You also downloaded PubChem Fingerprints. In this notebook, we will review the code and explore the `rdkit.DataStructs` package for working directly with bit vectors."
