    "This notebook is designed to follow the NLM [training course](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/oet/ed/pubchem/tutorial/index.html) on the use of PubChem. Each student will have their own copy of this notebook and should edit it as they see fit. That is, part of the goal of this initial activity is to assist students in creating content within Jupyter Notebooks.  This is also a chance for students to develop skills with [vibe coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding). "

    "Substances are the records associated with data uploaded to PubChem by individual depositors (sources) and include metadata like who the source is, the batch and testing conditions.
