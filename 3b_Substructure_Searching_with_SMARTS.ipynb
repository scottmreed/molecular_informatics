    "In the previous notebook, we explored how compounds can be stored in chemical databases using line notations such as SMILES, InChI, and InChIKeys. Each method has its benefits and challenges. We found that SMILES are non-canonical, meaning that a single molecule can be represented by multiple different SMILES strings. As a result, searching for a specific SMILES string may not yield a match if the database stores a different valid representation of the same molecule. This issue was addressed by the InChI format, which is canonical but not easily human-readable. Finally, we looked at InChIKeys, which are excellent for database searching due to their fixed-length, hash-like format. However, InChIKeys are one-way encodings, so the original structural data must be stored separately if reconstruction is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cheminformatics, searching for exact molecule matches isn't the only goal when interacting with a database. Frequently, we want to search for parts of molecules or \"substructures\" that contain specific chemical patterns or functional groups. This is particularly important for drug discovery, where known structural motifs may be required for biological activity at a given target. we would like to be able to search for similar molecules that contain those motifs. Being able to identify other molecules that contain such motifs allows researchers to prioritize compounds for synthesis, testing, or elimination based on the presence or absence of key substructures.\n",
    "\n",
    "While SMILES presented challenges to searching for specific molecules, a extension of that system called SMARTS (SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification) was developed. Unlike SMILES, which encodes full molecules, SMARTS allows the specification of generalized substructures using a flexible, rule-based syntax. SMARTS share a lot of the same syntax as SMILES but there are a number of critical differences. At a simple level, any SMILES is also a valid SMARTS. This enables highly customizable pattern matching for substructure queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how to define SMARTS queries, apply them to molecular datasets using RDKit, and visualize the results. Whether you're designing a drug lead or mining a large chemical database, substructure searching with SMARTS is a powerful skill in your cheminformatics toolkit."

    "Visualizing chemical substructures accurately is essential in cheminformatics and drug discovery. When RDKit highlights atoms and bonds based on a query, itâ€™s easy to assume the output is always correct. But sometimes, unexpected highlights can occur due to default settings or overlapping matches.<br><br> By taking control of how atoms and bonds are highlighted, youâ€™re not just fixing a display issue. You are learning how to verify results, debug molecular queries, and communicate chemical meaning more precisely. These are the same skills computational chemists use when developing structure-based filters, similarity searches, or pattern-based property prediction tools.<br><br> In short: <b>knowing what your code is highlighting, and why, helps you trust your results.</b>"

    "In many situations, we want to define a query that matches more than one type of atom. For example, suppose we want a pattern that can match both benzene and pyridine (both are six-membered aromatic rings) but with different atoms at one position. This can be accomplished in SMARTS by using a comma-separated list of atom types enclosed in square brackets. To match either a carbon or nitrogen at the final ring position, we can use the SMARTS pattern:\n",
    "```\n",
    "c1cccc[c,n]1\n",
    "```\n",
    "This pattern matches both benzene (where the final atom is `c`) and pyridine (where itâ€™s `n`). Notice that we are using lowercase `c` and `n` as we are indicating this is an aromatic ring.\n",

    "One last thing about `GetSubstructMatches()` that you should be aware of. When displaying a single molecule in a Jupyter notebook, RDKit automatically highlights the matched atoms because `GetSubstructMatch()` sets the internal match information and Jupyterâ€™s IPython integration checks for a stored match and highlights it using `__sssAtoms` behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, this only works for single molecules, because when you call a `mol` object alone, IPython draws it using special hooks behind the scenes. \n",
