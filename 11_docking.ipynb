    "## Molecular Docking Experiments with MolModa\n",
    "Optional Snow Day AssignmentThis assignment can replace your lowest homework grade if you choose to complete it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is based on an older assignment found here: \n",
    "https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/Intercollegiate_Courses/Cheminformatics/07%3A__Computer-Aided_Drug_Discovery_and_Design/7.05%3A_Molecular_Docking_Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "That older assignment requires installing a substantial amount of software on your computer which you are welcome to do if you want. The version below can be done without any installations. This version requires no software installation and can be completed using a web-based platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview\n",
    "You will use MolModa to perform molecular docking experiments on muscle glycogen phosphorylase (PDB ID: 1c8k) and ligand molecules from Assignment 8. Ensure you are using Chrome, as this method does not work on Safari.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to Complete the Assignment:\n",
    "1\tRetrieve Ligand List\n",
    "◦\tRe-run 8_virtual_screening.ipynb to retrieve the list of 5 values in my_cids.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\tOpen MolModa\n",
    "◦\tAccess MolModa at https://durrantlab.pitt.edu/molmoda/.\n",
    "\n",
    "3\tLoad the Ligand Structure\n",
    "◦\tUse File > Import Compound > PubChem to import from the CID number. Select \"desalt\".\n",
    "◦\tIn the Navigator, select the molecule, then protonate it at pH 7.4 using the Protonate tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "◦\tDelete the original molecule after protonation.\n",
    "4\tLoad the Protein Structure\n",
    "◦\tGo to File > PDB ID and enter 1c8k. The structure, including all chains, will load.\n",
    "\n",
    "5\tPrepare the Target Protein\n",
    "◦\tIn the Navigator pane:\n",
    "▪\tFind, select, and delete solvent molecules.\n",
    "▪\tFind, select, and delete the two co-crystallized molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "6\tProtonate the Protein\n",
    "◦\tSelect Proteins > Protonation to add hydrogen atoms.\n",
    "◦\tDelete the original unprotonated protein.\n",
    "\n",
    "7\tIdentify Binding Pockets\n",
    "◦\tUse Detect Pockets to locate binding sites.\n",
    "◦\tIn the Navigator pane, focus on the inhibitor CPB.\n",
    "◦\tClick the eyeball icon on each pocket until you find one that overlaps with CPB.\n",
    "\n",
    "8\tDelete the Ligand\n",
    "◦\tIn the Navigator pane, delete the CPB ligand.\n",
    "9\tSet Up the Docking Experiment\n",
    "◦\tGo to Docking > Compound.\n",
    "◦\tSelect the target pocket and the prepared ligand.\n",
    "◦\tAdjust the docking parameters (e.g., exhaustiveness) as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "10\tRun and Review Docking Results\n",
    "◦\tExecute the docking run.\n",
    "◦\tReview the poses and scores.\n",
    "◦\tVisualize top poses and analyze interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "11\tRepeat for Additional Ligands\n",
    "◦\tLoad and dock other ligand molecules using the same procedure.\n",
    "◦\tSave and analyze the docking results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "HW Submission:\n",
    "Submit the following:\n",
    "•\tThe top 5 SMILES codes.\n",
    "•\tBinding energy after docking.\n",
    "\n"
