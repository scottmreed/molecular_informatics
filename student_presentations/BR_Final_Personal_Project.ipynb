    "8-oxoG arises in both DNA and RNA during normal cellular processes and our research in the Resendiz lab focuses on one of the enzymes (Polynucleotide Phosphorylase) responsible for degrading oxidatively damaged or \"oxidized\" RNA, and how this degradation has been shown to stall when the PNPase enzyme encounters 8-oxoG. My project has focused on the relationship between the enzyme's stalled degradation and the specific sequence of the RNA being degraded. With this project, I hope to probe the human genome and specifically identify post transcriptional protein coding RNA that could be identified and checked for the specific sequence related to increased 8-oxoG stalling"
